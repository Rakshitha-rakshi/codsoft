            <h4>Chemical Fertilizers</h4>
            <p>
                Commercial fertilizers are used for both gardens and lawns in order to provide certain nutrients, namely nitrogen, potassium, and phosphorus, in highly concentrated doses.
                 When you purchase manufactured fertilizers, you will know precisely which nutrients the fertilizer provides and the amount of each nutrient the fertilizer offers.
                 Because fertilizers offer nutrients in such highly-concentrated forms, you will not need to use very much in order to replenish soil with the appropriate amounts needed to provide for your plants.
                The amount of fertilizer needed will be especially small in comparison to organic matter fertilizer alternatives, such as compost or manure.
                It is unfortunately quite easy to over fertilize lawns or young plants. Over fertilization can lead to burnt or damaged roots. 
                An unsightly example of overapplication of fertilizer is a lawn that turns completely brown after fertilization.
                Chemical fertilizers are synthetic or inorganic substances that provide essential nutrients to plants in a concentrated form. They are manufactured specifically to deliver precise amounts of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), often referred to as NPK,
                which are crucial for plant growth and development. Here are some key characteristics and considerations regarding chemical fertilizers
                Chemical fertilizers are formulated to contain specific amounts of nutrients essential for plant growth. This allows for precise application tailored to the needs of different plants and soils.
                Nutrients in chemical fertilizers are readily available to plants upon application. This immediate availability can lead to rapid growth responses and quick corrections of nutrient deficiencies.
                Due to their concentrated form, chemical fertilizers require smaller quantities compared to organic alternatives like compost or manure to achieve the same nutrient delivery. 
                This makes them efficient in terms of storage, transportation, and application.
                Application Methods: Chemical fertilizers are typically applied using various methods, including broadcast spreading, banding, and foliar spraying, depending on the crop and nutrient requirements.
                Proper handling and application of chemical fertilizers are crucial for safety and environmental protection. Regulations often govern their production, distribution, and use to minimize risks to human health and the environment.

            <h4>Natural manuers</h4>
            <p>
                when to use manure or fertilizer?
                
                If you have never worked with either fertilizer or manure, the difference between the two may be a bit puzzling. They both have a strong smell that may be a little overwhelming for those with sensitive noses. Both are also common additives for gardens to enrich soil and improve plant growth. Aside from these commonalities, fertilizer and manure vary quite a lot. One is all-natural, while the other can either be all-natural or a mix of various chemicals, mineral additives, and unknown substances.
                Understanding the values and differences of each substance can help you make well informed decisions when it comes to soil amendments in your garden. Read on to learn all you need to know about fertilizer and manure and how each substance can improve your garden’s soil.
                ABOUT FERTILIZER

                Nutrients available immediately
                Delivers nutrients in appropriate amount and proportions
                Can save time and effort compared to manure
                Does not introduce plant and animal disease causing organisms
                DISADVANTAGES OF FERTILIZER
                Most fertilizers do not contain micronutrients
                Fertilizers do not support microbiological life in soil
                Adding fertilizer does not add any organic material to soil
                Fertilizers can be costly
                Overuse or misuse can burn plant tissue and cause toxic concentration of salts
                Fertilizers can release nutrients too quickly
                Nutrients can be leached out of the soil very quickly by rain or irrigation.

            <h4>COW MANURE</h4>
            <p>
             Cows dung is a most important source of bio-fertilizer and used in many developing countries for generating energy.
              It is very effective's alternatives to chemical fertilizers by enhancing productivity in long term with maintaining the soil health and enhances the microbial population.
               Cowdung manure and vermicompost increases soil organic matter content, and this leads to improved water infiltration and water holding capacity as well as an increased cation exchange capacity.
                It is one of the renewable and sustainable energy resources through dung cakes or biogas which replace the dependence upon charcoal, fuel wood, firewood and fossil fuel etc.
                 Beside it, application of cowdung in proper and sustainable way can enhance not only productivity of yield but also minimizing the chances bacterial and fungal pathogenic disease.
                  Therefore, improper use of cowdung should be stopped and use as organic manure for maintaining productive and sustainable farming system. Introduction: Cows dung is a most important source of bio-fertilizer but at the same time cow's urine, cow's horn and a dead body of a cow can be used for preparing effective bio-fertilizer.
                   Animals can play an important role in the provision of energy either in negative way where livestock keeping contributes to deforestation in large parts of forested area or in positively, such as by transforming plant energy into useful work or by providing dung used for fuel through dung cakes or biogas to replace charcoal, fuel wood, firewood etc.
                    Most livestock products in mixed farming systems are derived from animals that are fed on local resources such as pasture, crop residues, fodder trees and shrubs. The farm animals (cows, bullocks and milk buffaloes) provide dung and urine to enrich the soil, while crop residues and fodder form the bulk of the feed for these animals (Kesavan and Swamina-than, 2008).
                     In our country, farming and agricultural cultivation, as per the traditional age-old system, used to be done, with cow dung amongst others serving as manure. There are a variety of cow dung and cow's urine products, which can be used as fertilizers and pest repellent respectively in agricultural practice. These products are very popular and are using day by day.
                      Low soil fertility is one of the greatest biophysical constraints to production of agroforestry crops across the world (Ajayi, 2007).

            <h4>POULTRY MANURE</h4>
            <p>
                Poultry farming is one of the most efficient animal husbandry methods and it provides nutritional security to a significant number of the world population.
                Using modern intensive farming techniques, global production has reached 133.4 mil. t in 2020, with a steady growth each year.
                 Such intensive growth methods however lead to a significant environmental footprint.
                  Waste materials such as poultry litter and manure can pose a serious threat to environmental and human health, and need to be managed properly.
                   Poultry production and waste by-products are linked to NH3, N2O and CH4 emissions, and have an impact on global greenhouse gas emissions, as well as animal and human health. 
                   Litter and manure can contain pesticide residues, microorganisms, pathogens, pharmaceuticals (antibiotics), hormones, metals, macronutrients (at improper ratios) and other pollutants which can lead to air, soil and water contamination as well as formation of antimicrobial/multidrug resistant strains of pathogens.
                    Dust emitted from intensive poultry production operations contains feather and skin fragments, faeces, feed particles, microorganisms and other pollutants, which can adversely impact poultry health as well as the health of farm workers and nearby inhabitants.
                    his tea contains a very concentrated amount of vital plant nutrients and can be diluted with water for regular application on garden plants.
                It is best to seek out a local source of sheep manure if you can. Oftentimes, farmers will sell the manure to you for a reasonable price. Some farmers will even allow you to come and collect your own manure, a venture well worth the time

            <h4>SHEEP MANURE</h4>
            <p>
                Using sheep manure for the garden is not a new idea. People all over the world have been using animal manures as a very effective organic material in gardens for a very, very long time.
                 Sheep manure is referred to as cold manure because of its low nitrogen content. This makes it an excellent addition to any garden.
                Sheep manure, like other animal manures, is a natural slow-release fertilizer. Nutrients in sheep manure fertilizer provide adequate nourishment for a garden.
                 It is high in both phosphorus and potassium, essential elements for optimal plant growth. These nutrients help plants to establish strong roots, defend against pests and grow into vibrant and productive plants. 
                 Sheep manure can also be used as organic mulch. Because of its low odor, sheep manure can easily be used to top dress garden beds. A garden bed that has a high level of organic matter drains well and has a high number of earthworms and soil microbial activity, all good for plants.
                Composting sheep manure is similar to composting other animal manures. The manure must have time to age before using it in the garden.
                 Composting bins can be constructed to hold sheep manure and require regular aeration for proper curing. Some people enjoy composting sheep manure in bins that allow you to drain out the sheep manure tea. This tea contains a very concentrated amount of vital plant nutrients and can be diluted with water for regular application on garden plants.
                It is best to seek out a local source of sheep manure if you can. Oftentimes, farmers will sell the manure to you for a reasonable price. Some farmers will even allow you to come and collect your own manure, a venture well worth the time

            <h4>HORSE MANURE</h4>
            <p>
                Horse manure is a valuable organic material that serves as a natural fertilizer and soil amendment in gardening and agriculture. Here are some key aspects and benefits of using horse manure:
                Nutrient Content: Horse manure is rich in essential nutrients such as nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K), which are vital for plant growth. These nutrients help improve soil fertility and support healthy plant development.
                Organic Matter: Horse manure contributes organic matter to the soil, which improves soil structure, enhances water retention, and promotes beneficial microbial activity. This organic matter breakdown releases nutrients gradually, providing long-term benefits to plants.
                Availability and Application: Horse manure is generally available from horse farms, stables, or facilities that manage horses. It can be applied to gardens and agricultural fields after composting or aged sufficiently to reduce weed seeds and potential pathogens.
                Composting: Composting horse manure is a common practice to improve its quality and reduce potential odors. Properly composted horse manure transforms into a stable, nutrient-rich material that can be safely applied to plants without the risk of burning.
                Soil Amendment: When incorporated into the soil, horse manure improves soil structure by increasing aeration and drainage. This supports root growth and nutrient uptake by plants, leading to healthier and more resilient crops.
                Environmental Benefits: Using horse manure as a fertilizer promotes sustainable agricultural practices by recycling organic waste and reducing reliance on synthetic fertilizers. It also contributes to reducing landfill waste and conserving natural resources.
